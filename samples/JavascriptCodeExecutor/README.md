Google Gemini Code Generation Demonstration

This is a demonstration of how to utilize the capabilities of Google Gemini for code generation and function calling.
The `Google_GenerativeAI` SDK offers a simple and efficient way to integrate AI-powered features into your projects.

Additionally, this SDK leverages the [JINT](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint) JavaScript interpreter, which is
licensed under the BSD license. You can review the specifics in the `LICENSE.md` file of the project.

## Key Features of Google_GenerativeAI SDK:

1. **Effortless Code Integration**: The SDK simplifies code integration through intuitive APIs.
2. **Advanced Code Generation**: Use Gemini's generative AI capabilities to generate contextual and optimized code.
3. **Function Call Capabilities**: Dynamically invoke functions and streamline application logic.
4. **Extensibility via JINT**: Execute and manipulate JavaScript code within .NET applications.
